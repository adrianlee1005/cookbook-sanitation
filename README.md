# Tracking Sanitation in Historic American Cookbooks

This project explores how sanitation-related language evolved in American cookbooks between 1800 and 1920, during the rise of germ theory and modern food safety practices. Using a corpus of 74 historical cookbooks from the *Feeding America: Historic American Cookbook Collection*, I apply corpus-based text analysis to examine the distribution, frequency, and contextual usage of cleanliness-related terms.

The analysis compares long-standing general cleanliness vocabulary (e.g., *boil*, *clean*, *wash*) with emerging scientific sanitation terms (e.g., *sterilize*, *disinfect*) using frequency distributions, normalized time-series trends, log-likelihood keyness, and collocation networks. Results show that scientific sanitation language appears late and remains rare, supplementing rather than replacing traditional domestic cleanliness discourse.
